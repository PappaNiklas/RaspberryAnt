# RaspberryAnt
Using to Raspberry to drive a Hexapod

Note: This project is a work in progress.

# About
This project is based around Python and two Raspberry Pi. The robot is a 6-legged (hexapod) robot with 3 degrees of freedom per leg. It is controlled with a converted PS2 controller

# Hardware sender
-  An old broken LyxMotion PS2-copy
-  OLED ssd1306 for the 0.96" or sh1106 for the 1.3"
-  1 x Raspberry Pi 1B
-  1 x Low-power Edimax USB wifi module used for connection to a home network
-  1 x XBee module used for connection between robot and the PS2 controller


# Hardware receiver

-  1 x Raspberry Pi 2B
-  1 x Low-power Edimax USB wifi module used for connection to a home network
-  1 x XBee module used for connection between robot and the PS2 controller
-  2 x 16-Channel 12-bit PWM Drivers used for control of the servo PWM signals. This is based on the PCA9685 which has its own internal clock. 
-  18 x High Torque digital servos Hitec HS-5645MG
-  1 x 2s1p Lipo Battery Pack
-  2 x 8-15A UBEC for converting the 8.4V from the Lipo Battery to 6V for the servos, 10A fuse
-  1 x BEC for converting the 8.4V from the Lipo Battery to the 5V raspberry
-  1 x Hexapod Basemodel BH3 from Lynxmotion http://www.lynxmotion.com/c-33-bh3.aspx
-  1 x Simple LiPo low voltage alarm (as a plugg)
-  1 x Adafruit ADS1015 as a LiPo low voltage alarm over I2C

# Software

The following modules should be installed using apt-get after installing Raspbian on the Raspberry Pi:
-  Python 2.7
-  Adafruit Adafruit_PWM_Servo_Driver
-  Adafruit 17006-driver
-  OLED 1306 (courtesy ofRichard Hull)
-  PIL

The basecode for the robot is taken from the Phoenix-project, originally written in Micro Basic for the ARC32 by 
Xan (Jeroen Janssen) 
Zenta (KÃ¥re Halvorsen)
KurtE (Kurt Eckhardt)
